## Overview:
This app will allow an employer to easily organize their employees.  Using MySQL a database is created that holds three seperate tables.  These tables contain employee, position, and department info.  The user is then able to manipulate the data in these tables by simply running through prompted questions.  This was primarily accomplished using Javascript, Node.JS, Inquirer, and MySQL.

### How it works!
After following the installation process for this app, run the command node app.js and a directory will appear.  This directory has options for the user to add a department, a role, or an employee.  It also has options to view the current departments, roles, and employees already entered into the database.  Lastly there is an option to update an exiting employees role.  Select one of these options from the directory and answer the prompted questions!
